                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Much has been written about optimal betting strategies for a gambler who is faced with an infinite
sequence of profitable bets. 
Here I will briefly describe the “Kelly criterion” for optimal bet sizes and
extend the discussion to situations where the odds attached to winning are a random variable. 
Finally I will discuss the these results in the context of betting in financial markets.</p>
<p>An even-odds bet where the probability of winning is greater than <span class="math">\(50\%\)</span> is an example of a profitable bet. How much
should you wager, as a fraction of your capital, given the opportunity to place this bet infinitely many
times in a row? In 1956 J. L. Kelly Jr., a researcher at Bell Labs, solved the question with the goal of
maximizing the growth rate of capital. In the situation with even odds, to maximize the growth rate
you should bet the fraction <span class="math">\(f=p - q\)</span> of your wealth, where <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is the probability of winning and <span class="math">\(q = 1 – p\)</span> 
is the probability of losing. 
For instance if you gain your bet with probability <span class="math">\(p = 75\%\)</span> and lose your bet with
probability <span class="math">\(q = 25\%\)</span>, then you should wager <span class="math">\(50\%\)</span> of your capital in each period in order to maximize its
growth rate over the long term. 
As has been well-documented, betting “full Kelly” is quite aggressive and
can lead to large losses over the short term. 
In this case there is a <span class="math">\(25\%\)</span> chance of losing half of one's wealth in a single bet!
It is not for everybody, but from the perspective of wealth generation it dominates any other strategy over time.</p>
<h3>Fixed odds</h3>
<p>What fraction <span class="math">\(f\)</span> should we wager when the bets pay odds <span class="math">\(b\)</span> not necessarily equal to 1?
Kelly's insight is that we can find the growth-rate-optimal betting fraction <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> by maximizing our expected log of wealth in a single period. 
Without loss of generality we can normalize our current wealth to be 1, in which case <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> maximizes</p>
<div class="math">$$E\{\log_{}(\text{wealth})\}=p\log_{}(1+pf)+q\log_{}(1-f)$$</div>
<p>Taking the derivative with respect to <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, setting equal to zero, and examining second derivative properties
gives a maximum at</p>
<div class="math">$$f^*=\frac{pb-q}{b}$$</div>
<p>Thus, <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> is the “edge” divided by the odds. 
Notice that for an even odds bet, <span class="math">\(b=1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f^*=p – q\)</span> as stated above.</p>
<h3>Random odds</h3>
<h4>Case #1: discrete uniform</h4>
<p>Let’s now consider adding a random component to the odds <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.
We may still lose our entire bet <span class="math">\(f\)</span> with probability <span class="math">\(q\)</span>, 
but instead of winning <span class="math">\(bf\)</span> with probability <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, we win</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
(b-\alpha)f \text{ with probability }0.5p \\
(b+\alpha)f \text{ with probability }0.5p
\end{align}</div>
<p>for some <span class="math">\(\alpha \geq 0\)</span>. The odds are still <span class="math">\(b\)</span> <em>in expectation</em>, but if <span class="math">\(\alpha &gt; 0\)</span> then there is some variation thrown
in the mix. By the concavity of the <span class="math">\(\log\)</span> function (Jensen's inequality), 
we will want to bet somewhat less than the optimal bet amount
in the fixed-odds case, which I label <span class="math">\(f^*_{\alpha=0}\)</span>. </p>
<p>What actually is the optimal fraction to bet? How does it relate to <span class="math">\(f^*_{\alpha=0}\)</span>?</p>
<p>Let's define a discrete uniform random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> with the following distribution:</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
  X = 
  \begin{cases}
    b-\alpha &amp; \text{with probability $0.5$} \\
    b+\alpha &amp; \text{with probability $0.5$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}</div>
<div class="math">$$E(X)=b$$</div>
<div class="math">$$Var(X)=E(X^2)-E(X)^2=\alpha^2$$</div>
<p>We want to maximize</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
E\{\log_{}(\text{wealth})\}&amp;=E\{p\log_{}(1+Xf)+q\log_{}(1-f)\} \\
&amp; = 0.5p\log_{}(1+(b-\alpha)f)+0.5p\log_{}(1+(b+\alpha)f)+q\log_{}(1-f)
\end{align}</div>
<p>To maximize this we again take the derivative with respect to <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and set it to zero.
Some algebra yields the quadratic equation </p>
<div class="math">$$0=-(b^2–a^2)f^2 + (p(b^2–a^2) + b(p–2))f + p(b+1) – 1$$</div>
<p>Let’s examine this in the case where <span class="math">\(\alpha=b\)</span>.
The solution to the equation then becomes</p>
<div class="math">$$\begin{eqnarray} f^*=\frac{pb-q}{b(1+q)}=\frac{f^*_{\alpha=0}}{1+q} \end{eqnarray}$$</div>
<p>With <span class="math">\(q&gt;0\)</span>, the optimal bet size is the fixed-odds optimal bet size multiplied by a factor less than 1.
In the betting setup first described in the previous section,
with even odds and <span class="math">\(p=75\%\)</span>, the growth rate optimal bet amount is reduced from <span class="math">\(50\%\)</span> to <span class="math">\(40\%\)</span> when <span class="math">\(\alpha=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>To keep things simple let’s stick with the even-odds case for the remainder of this post.
Setting <span class="math">\(b = 1\)</span> into the quadratic equation turns it into
</p>
<div class="math">$$0 = -vf^2 + (p(v+1) - 2)f + 2p – 1 \text{  where }v = (1 - \alpha^2)$$</div>
<p>For <span class="math">\(\alpha^2=Var(X)\ne 1\)</span>, the solution becomes:</p>
<div class="math">$$f^*=\frac{2-p(v+1)\pm\sqrt{p^2(v+1)^2+4(p-1)(v-1)}}{-2v}$$</div>
<p>We can quickly check which of the two roots to use by setting <span class="math">\(\alpha^2=0 \Rightarrow v=1\)</span>, 
in which case we have removed the random component and are back to the fixed-odds scenario. 
The minus sign gives the anticipated result <span class="math">\(f^*=f^*_{\alpha=0, \text{ }b=1}=p-q\)</span>.</p>
<h4>Case #2: continuous uniform</h4>
<p>What if our random odds are continuous and distributed uniformly over the entire interval <span class="math">\([b-\alpha, b+\alpha]\)</span>?</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> denote these new random odds, with probability density function
</p>
<div class="math">\begin{equation}
  g_Y(y) = 
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{2\alpha} &amp; y \in [b-\alpha, b+\alpha] \\
    0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}</div>
<p>Note that 
</p>
<div class="math">$$Var(Y)=\frac{4}{12}\alpha^2=\frac{1}{3}Var(X) \leq Var(X)$$</div>
<p> 
so that we should be betting <em>more</em> than the discrete-odds case of the previous section for any chosen <span class="math">\(\alpha&gt;0\)</span>. 
<strong>It can be shown that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> has the highest possible variance of any random variable over the interval <span class="math">\([b-\alpha, b+\alpha]\)</span>, a fact which we will use 
in the next section to generate conservative betting estimates.</strong> </p>
<p>Now our objective function is</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
E\{\log_{}(\text{wealth})\}&amp;=E\{p\log_{}(1+Yf)+q\log_{}(1-f)\} \\
&amp; = \int_{b-\alpha}^{b+\alpha} \! p\log(1+yf) \, g_Y(y)\mathrm{d}y + q\log(1-f) \\
&amp; = \frac{p}{2\alpha}\int_{b-\alpha}^{b+\alpha} \! \log(1+yf) \, \mathrm{d}y + q\log(1-f)
\end{align}</div>
<p>Which we maximize by taking the derivative with respect to <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and setting equal to zero</p>
<div class="math">\begin{align}
0 &amp;= \frac{p}{2{\alpha}} \int_{b-\alpha}^{b+\alpha} \! \frac{y}{1+fy}\mathrm{d}y - \frac{q}{1-f} \\
  &amp;= \frac{p}{2{\alpha}f} \int_{b-\alpha}^{b+\alpha} \! \frac{fy}{1+fy}\mathrm{d}y - \frac{q}{1-f} \\
  &amp;= \frac{p}{2{\alpha}f} \left( \int_{b-\alpha}^{b+\alpha} \! \mathrm{d}y - \int_{b-\alpha}^{b+\alpha} \! \frac{\mathrm{d}y}{1+fy} \right) - \frac{q}{1-f} \\
  &amp;= \frac{p}{2{\alpha}f} \left( 2\alpha - \frac{1}{f}\log\left(\frac{1+(b+\alpha)f}{1+(b-\alpha)f}\right) \right) - \frac{q}{1-f}
\end{align}</div>
<p>Solving numerically for the even-expected-odds case <span class="math">\((b=1)\)</span> for various <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> gives 
the following plot for <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span>. Also included is the same plot for the discrete random odds case.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src={{ url_for("static", filename="bet_fraction_plot.png") }}></p>
<p>Notice that as <span class="math">\(\alpha \to 0\)</span> the optimal bet amounts converge to the corresponding fixed-odds optimal bet amounts. 
In the case of <span class="math">\(p=75\%\)</span>, we can see from the chart that the optimal amount to bet is <span class="math">\(50\%\)</span> with fixed odds, 
and following the solid green line to <span class="math">\(\alpha=1.00\)</span>, the optimal bet amount in the discrete random odds case 
is <span class="math">\(40\%\)</span>, which we proved mathematically in the previous section. Some final things to notice are that <span class="math">\(f^{*}\)</span> in the case of 
continuously-distributed random odds is greater than the corresponding <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> for discrete random odds when <span class="math">\(\alpha &gt; 0\)</span>, 
and even though the difference is not much for <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> near zero, it can be considerable for larger <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Application to financial markets</h3>
<p>Below is an example of a potential scenario in which the above results may be helpful.
But it does not constitute financial advice, and you should not trade options unless you are experienced.</p>
<p>A not-illegal rumor is swirling that company XYZ will receive an acquisition offer some time before the third Friday of the month. Relevant details are:</p>
<ul>
<li>XYZ stock trades for €100 </li>
<li>You assign <span class="math">\(p=25\%\)</span> to the probability of there being a legitimate offer in this time frame</li>
<li>Should an offer come, you expect it to be for €130 per share, but may be as low as €120 or as high as €140</li>
<li>Call options on XYZ with strike of €120 cost €1</li>
<li>If an offer is made, XYZ stock will jump to the offer price, otherwise it will languish and the option will expire worthless</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming your portfolio is all cash and that this XYZ option is the only investible game in town,
what fraction might you want to bet on the XYZ €120 call?</p>
<p>Given the option costs €1, the realized odds of this bet in the event of an offer will range from
-1 at €120 to +19 at €140. This corresponds to a random odds scenario as described in the post, with <span class="math">\(p=25\%, b=9, \text{and } \alpha=10\)</span>. 
We can use the results above to calculate the bet amounts.</p>
<p>With the ability to make this investment infinitely many times (!), the growth-rate optimal bet amounts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>16.67% if you fully believe that the offer will be €130 and nothing else (this is the <span class="math">\(\alpha=0\)</span> fixed odds case)</li>
<li>13.78% if you believe that the offer has an equal chance of being any price between €120 and €140 (uniform continuous odds case)</li>
<li>7.89% if you want to be conservative (uniform discrete odds case)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This post started with an explanation of classic growth-rate-optimal (Kelly) betting with odds <span class="math">\(b\)</span>,
and extended the idea to two cases in which odds are a random variable with expected value <span class="math">\(b\)</span> over a fixed interval.</p>
<p>The length of the interval is linked to the variance of the odds and inversely to the growth-rate optimal bet amount <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span>. </p>
<p>For large <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> relative to <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f^*\)</span> can vary greatly depending on how the odds are actually distributed, 
something which can be seen in the plot and in the application to options trading in the final section.</p>
